- `storyStore` - Story metadata and structure
- `editorStore` - Current editor state (content, cursor, mode)
- `settingsStore` - User preferences
- `aiStore` - AI models, settings, completions
- `uiStore` - UI state (theme, active chapter, etc.)

### Key APIs/Modules
- `ollama.ts` - Ollama API client
- `filesystem.ts` - File operations via Tauri
- `markdown.ts` - Markdown rendering and parsing
- `storage.ts` - Local storage management
- `context-builder.ts` - AI context assembly

### Storage Structure
```
story-project/
  story.json              # Metadata
  chapters/
    chapter-1/
      content.md          # Chapter content
      metadata.json       # Chapter properties
    chapter-2/
      content.md
      metadata.json
  backups/                # Automatic backups
  .backup/                # Auto-save recovery
```
